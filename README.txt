WDaliClock is a quick-and-dirty port of a XDaliClock, a digital clock with
"melting" digits for the X Window System.  It runs under Windows 2000
and XP, and under '98 with the exception of the transparency feature.

Just unzip it and place it wherever you want.  All settings are stored in
a user-specific text file:
 "C:\Documents and Settings\%user%\Application Data\WDaliClock.Settings.txt"

Left-click on the window and draw to move it, and right-click on it to bring
up a menu with configuration options.

Source and latest version is available at http://www.ziplabel.com/wdaliclock

TODO:
. Date display?
. Optimize, do some caching of bitmaps
. Add support for custom fonts
. Replace clock in toolbar with a Dali clock
